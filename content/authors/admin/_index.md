I am an MC2 Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Maryland Cybersecurity Center (MC2)](https://cyber.umd.edu/about) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu). I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu), advised by [Prof. David Evans](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) and [Prof. Yuan Tian](https://www.ytian.info) at UCLA. I am interested in machine learning for security and the trustworthy aspects of machine learning, especially in malicious training environments.
