I am a Ph.D candidate at the Computer Science department of the University of Virginia.
My advisors are [Prof. David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) and [Prof. Yuan Tian](https://www.ytian.info). I am interested in studying the trustwothy aspects of machine learning models under contaminated data/model.
