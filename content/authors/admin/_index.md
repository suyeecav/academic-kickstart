I am a final year PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), advised by Professor [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/). My primary area of research is privacy/security in machine learning, with a focus on distribution inference.
