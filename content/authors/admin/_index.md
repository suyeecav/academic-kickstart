I am an MC2 Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Maryland Cybersecurity Center (MC2)](https://cyber.umd.edu/about) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu). I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu), advised by [Prof. David Evans](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) and [Prof. Yuan Tian](https://www.ytian.info) at UCLA. I am interested in machine learning for security and the trustworthy aspects of machine learning, especially in malicious training environments. 

<span style="color: blue;">I am joining [the Min H. Kao Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.utk.edu) at [the University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://www.utk.edu) as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Fall 2024. I am looking for self-motivated students to work on trustworthy machine learning and machine learning for security. Feel free to send me an email if you are interested.

**News:**
- My first SoK paper is accepted to IEEE SaTML 2024, see you in Toronto!
