abstract: In a poisoning attack, an adversary with control over a small fraction of the training data attempts to select that data in a way that induces a corrupted model that misbehaves in favor of the adversary. We consider poisoning attacks against convex machine learning models and propose an efficient poisoning attack designed to induce a specified model. Unlike previous model-targeted poisoning attacks, our attack comes with provable convergence to <i>any</i> attainable target classifier. The distance from the induced classifier to the target classifier is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of poisoning points. We also provide a lower bound on the minimum number of poisoning points needed to achieve a given target classifier. Our method uses online convex optimization, so finds poisoning points incrementally. This provides more flexibility than previous attacks which require a priori assumption about the number of poisoning points. Our attack is the first model-targeted poisoning attack that provides provable convergence for convex models, and in our experiments, it either exceeds or matches state-of-the-art attacks in terms of attack success rate and distance to the target model.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We propose efficient data poisoning attacks that can asymptotically approach a target model with desired properties.
